    <h4>1. Introduction</h4>
    <p>
      Welcome to Cash2Captcha ("we," "us," or "our"). Cash2Captcha is an online Captcha platform that allows Users and Agents to participate in Captcha solving and earn rewards. These Terms and Conditions (“Terms”) govern your use of our platform, along with our Privacy Policy.

    <h4>2. Eligibility</h4>
    <p><strong>About Captcha and Captcha Word:</strong> We use captcha and captcha words as content only; we do not sell, misuse, or do anything unethical with this (Captcha).</p>

      <li>By using the Service, you confirm that you have the legal capacity to enter into this agreement under Indian law.</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Types of Captchas:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Text-Based Captcha:</strong> Users enter distorted letters/numbers from an image.</li>
      <li><strong>Image Recognition:</strong> Users identify specific objects such as signals, roads, or vehicles.</li>
      <li><strong>Checkbox Captcha:</strong> Users check a box to verify they are human.</li>

    <p><strong>What is the use of Captcha?</strong></p>
    <p>
      Captcha is a security measure used to differentiate between humans and bots. Captchas prevent bots from interacting with websites or misusing services.
    </p>

    <p><strong>How Captchas Work:</strong></p>
    <ol>
      <li>Website presents a captcha during sensitive actions.</li>
      <li>Users solve text, image, checkbox, or ReCAPTCHA challenges.</li>
      <li>Server validates the captcha response.</li>
      <li>Bots fail due to unpredictability and human-based verification.</li>
      <li>Captcha systems are constantly updated for improved security.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>
      We give captcha typing work for practice purposes only, to teach users how to type correct captchas. Captchas are used as content like other applications. More users increase traffic, improving platform performance.
    </p>
